Now  lets  create  the   economic  calendar  

Objective:
Create a dynamic, real-time economic calendar that tracks and analyzes key financial data releases and market-moving events for currencies and major stocks. The system must present expected, previous, and actual data, assess market impacts, and visualize pre-release expectations based on futures market behavior.

🧩 Core Features & Functionality
1. Data Coverage
•	Include all high-impact and medium-impact economic events or reports (e.g., CPI, NFP, GDP, interest rate decisions, PMI, etc.).
•	Cover both currency markets and major global stocks/indices (e.g., S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow, FTSE, DAX, Nikkei, major blue-chip companies).

2. Pre-Release Data Expectations
•	Before each report’s release, highlight:
o	Expected value (forecast) – derived from consensus estimates.
o	Previous value – for comparison.
o	Implied market expectation – inferred from futures price movements, including:
	Interest rate futures
	Treasury futures
	FX futures
o	This futures-based expectation applies only to currencies.

3. Post-Release Data Analysis
•	Once the actual data/report is released, automatically display:
o	Actual value
o	Previous value
o	Expected value
o	Difference between actual and expected (surprise factor)
o	Calculated impact on related assets:
	Currencies (via FX futures and spot reactions)
	Stocks (via market index and company-level movement)
•	Provide a brief AI-generated analysis summarizing likely market reactions and trends.

4. Impact Indicators
