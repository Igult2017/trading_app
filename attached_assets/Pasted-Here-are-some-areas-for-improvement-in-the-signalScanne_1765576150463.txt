Here are some areas for improvement in the signalScanner.ts:
1.	Error Handling:
o	Improve error handling across network requests (e.g., fetching live prices, multi-timeframe data). Currently, if one request fails, it could break the entire process. Implement retries, timeouts, or fallback strategies.
2.	Optimization:
o	Consider optimizing the filterTradeableInstruments() function to ensure faster execution, particularly when dealing with a large number of instruments.
o	Use parallel processing where possible to speed up the fetching of data (e.g., fetching prices or candle data for multiple instruments simultaneously).
3.	Code Modularity:
o	Break down the scanMarkets() function into smaller, more manageable helper functions to improve readability and maintainability.
o	Separate logic related to data fetching, strategy execution, and validation into distinct modules or services.
4.	Logging:
o	Introduce more granular logging throughout the workflow (e.g., data fetching, strategy execution, validation) for better debugging and monitoring.
o	Use a structured logging framework (like Winston) to capture and save logs in a standardized format.
5.	Caching:
o	Cache the multi-timeframe data for each instrument to avoid redundant fetching of the same data in short intervals. Use a memory store (like Redis) to store frequently accessed data.
6.	Gemini AI Validation:
o	Enhance the validateWithGemini() function to include more detailed checks, such as assessing the potential risk or volatility of a signal before validation.
o	Improve the AI model to handle edge cases or rare market conditions more effectively.
7.	Signal Expiry:
o	Introduce logic for handling expired signals before the 4-hour expiry time. This could prevent unnecessary database storage of inactive signals.
8.	Signal Confidence:
o	Introduce dynamic thresholds for confidence levels based on market conditions or instrument types. For instance, adjust the minimum confidence required for a signal based on market volatility.
9.	Testing:
•	Implement unit and integration tests, particularly for the scanMarkets() function and strategy execution logic, to ensure the system behaves as expected under various scenarios.
