Here are my recommendations for improvements in the strategies/smc.py code but  ignore if  they have  already been implemented  in  another  code:
1. Swing Quality Not Considered
•	Recommendation: Enhance swing analysis to factor in not only the direction (HH/HL/LH/LL) but also the size and strength of the swings. Larger swings could be given more weight, and additional measures like momentum or velocity could be introduced to capture the impact of significant price moves.
2. No Recency Weighting
•	Recommendation: Implement weighted averaging for recent swings so that more recent swings (e.g., within the last 3-5 periods) are given a higher weight in trend and zone calculations. This can better reflect the current market behavior and avoid outdated influences skewing results.
3. Zone Analysis Is Basic
•	Recommendation:
o	Introduce zone freshness by adding a time decay function to make newer zones more reliable. Older zones should gradually lose relevance in the calculation.
o	Add logic to detect overlapping zones and consider them messy or less reliable.
o	Consider proximity to the current price to improve the relevance of zones closer to the price action. Zones that are far away from the price may not be as significant.
4. Hardcoded Parameters
•	Recommendation: Replace the hardcoded parameters (e.g., "last 8 swings", "last 6 swings") with dynamic parameters that adapt to the instrument or timeframe. For example, use a configuration file or an adaptive function that adjusts these values based on the specific conditions or market volatility for each instrument.
5. No Volume Data
•	Recommendation: Incorporate volume analysis into the trend and zone calculations. High volume in a zone could indicate strength or validation of the zone, and similarly, the volume during swing points could provide insights into the reliability of the trend or reversal.
6. No Session/Time Context
•	Recommendation: Introduce a session-based or time-aware factor. For example, implement logic that detects the current market session (e.g., London, New York) and adjusts the analysis based on the session's typical volatility or behavior. Market conditions often behave differently during session overlaps, which could be factored into the trend and zone analysis.
7. Single Timeframe Only
•	Recommendation: Add multi-timeframe analysis, where the strategy conflates the trends from different timeframes (e.g., 5-minute, 15-minute, 1-hour or 1D , 4H, 30mins and 5min just  dynamic  enough  to  provide  a clear  picture  and   accuracy) to get a clearer picture of the overall market structure. A strategy that aligns trends across multiple timeframes is often more reliable.
8. General Optimization
•	Recommendation:
o	Refactor code to increase modularity and readability. Each function can be made more independent with clear inputs and outputs.
o	Optimize performance by using more efficient data structures for storing and analyzing the swings (e.g., using deque for storing sliding windows of swings).
o	Implement unit tests to validate the logic and correctness of each function, especially when changes are made.
By addressing these points, the strategy's robustness and accuracy would improve significantly, making it more adaptable to different market conditions and instruments.
