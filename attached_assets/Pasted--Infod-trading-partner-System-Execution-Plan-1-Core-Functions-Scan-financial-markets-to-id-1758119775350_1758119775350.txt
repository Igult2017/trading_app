5. Signal Identification Process
•	Identify high-probability setups based on confluence of:
a)	Price Action + SMC.
•	Imbalance 
•	Institutional candles 
•	FVG
•	Order blocks 
•	Liquidity voids 
•	Breaker blocks 
•	Mitigation blocks 
•	Unmitigated demands 
•	Unmitigated supplies 
•	Finobacci for equilibrium or PD arrays 
•	Price taking equal highs or lows in support and resistance to activate buys or sells 
•	
a)	Market structure.
b)	Technical indicators.
c)	Fundamentals.
o	But where the system confirms a higher probability signal, it can provide it, give bias and also state it is not based on confluence 
•	
o	
•	Signals are validated across multi-timeframes (1M, 5M, 30M, 4H, 1D, 1W).
•	Best signals are chosen when trend confirmation aligns in 5M → 1W.
•	Alternative signals: Accepted if strong confluence exists, even without full multi-timeframe alignment.

6. Signal Management
•	Track top 5 upcoming signals at a time.
o	Monitor until confirmed or invalidated.
o	Replace invalidated ones with new opportunities.
o	Only post or provide confirmed signals 
•	Avoid duplicate trades on the same pair/instrument, unless:
o	First trade is for scalping.
•	Confirmed signals include:
o	Entry + Exit levels.
o	Risk-to-Reward ratio (min 1:2)
o	Supporting factors for bias.

7. Trade History & Learning
•	Store each trade with:
o	Entry reason.
o	Timeframe basis (HTF, TTF, ETF).
o	Outcome (win/loss).

•	Archive expired/lost trades into trade history.
•	Auto-analysis: After every 50 trades, system reviews performance to refine strategies.

8. Fundamentals Module
•	Display news calendar with:
o	Upcoming events.
o	Expected vs. previous values.
o	Projected market impact (positive/negative).

o	New trading opportunities.
